# HuntMaps (True Map)

A web-first, open-source mapping application for land owners and hunters to map their land in detail as well as track hunts, sightings, trails, terrain, and media. 

Built with React, TypeScript, Cesium, and OpenLayers.

OnX is expensive and I don't love their UI for mapping your property. I wanted to create something where you can map your property features in depth and create a "true map" of your property.
